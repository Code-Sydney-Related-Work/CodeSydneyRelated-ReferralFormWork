Code Sydney - Deadly Connection Project Related - Referral Form Development

This 'Referral Form' was created as a part of our project (Project Deadly Connection) at Code.Sydney. The technologies used here were HTML, CSS and JavaScript(Vanilla). The editor used was VScode. The requirements for this activity were,

  1. A Form that allows entry of details of a new client being referred to Deadly Connection, an Aboriginal Welfare Organisation.
  2. The Form should be able to save the entered details in Local Storage at the prototype stage.
  3. The details of the clients should be accessible and editable.
